The game was originally set to release in early 2001 and required the use of the Nintendo 64's RAM Expansion Pak. However, after a well-received demo at E3 2000, Nintendo suggested that Rare should merge the game with the Star Fox series, as they saw similarities between Sabre and Fox McCloud. Rare agreed to the idea, and Dinosaur Planet was reworked into Star Fox Adventures for the GameCube, which was released in 2002.
 
In Star Fox Adventures, Sabre was replaced by Fox McCloud, while Krystal was reduced to a minor role. Many of the original concepts and characters from Dinosaur Planet were scrapped or changed, such as the magic system, the tribal factions, and the plot. Star Fox Adventures received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics, controls, and gameplay variety. However, many fans of the Star Fox series were disappointed by the game's departure from the traditional space shooter gameplay of previous entries.
 
In February 2021, a prototype ROM of Dinosaur Planet dated December 1st, 2000 was leaked online by a group of preservationists who bought it from a private collector in Sweden. The ROM shows an unfinished version of the game that features Fox McCloud instead of Sabre, but still retains most of the original elements from Dinosaur Planet. The ROM also contains numerous security protections that make it unplayable on emulators or flash carts without modifications.
 
Fortunately, the community has been working together to crack the ROM and make it playable for everyone. They have also been creating patches and fixes to improve the performance and stability of the game, as well as restoring content that was inaccessible or cut from the final version.

## The History of Dinosaur Planet's Development
 
Dinosaur Planet's development began in late 1997, after the release of Diddy Kong Racing. Rare was wanting to make a spin-off to the title, using one of its characters, Timber the Tiger, as the main protagonist. The game was initially planned for the Nintendo 64DD, an add-on that allowed for more storage space and online features. However, due to the commercial failure of the 64DD in Japan, Rare decided to switch to a standard Nintendo 64 cartridge instead.
 
The game was inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which had set a new standard for 3D action-adventure games. Rare wanted to create a similar game with a more complex story, branching paths, and multiple playable characters. The game's setting was changed from a tropical island to a prehistoric world populated by dinosaurs and other creatures. The game's name was changed to Dinosaur Planet, and Timber was replaced by two new characters: Sabre, a young warrior fox, and Krystal, a mysterious vixen with magical powers.
 
The game's development was ambitious and challenging, as Rare pushed the limits of the Nintendo 64 hardware. The game used advanced graphics techniques such as bump mapping, dynamic lighting, and facial animation. The game also featured voice acting for all the characters, which required a lot of compression to fit on the cartridge. The game's script was written by Steve Malpass and Leigh Loveday, who had previously worked on Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo-Kazooie. The game's music was composed by David Wise, who had created the soundtracks for Donkey Kong Country and Diddy Kong Racing.
 
The game was first revealed to the public at E3 2000, where it received positive feedback from critics and fans. The game was scheduled to be released in early 2001, but it was delayed several times due to its complexity and scope. During this time, Nintendo approached Rare with a proposal: to merge Dinosaur Planet with the Star Fox series, which had been dormant since Star Fox 64 in 1997. Nintendo saw similarities between Sabre and Fox McCloud, and thought that adding the Star Fox brand would boost the game's sales and appeal.
 
Rare agreed to the idea, and began to rework Dinosaur Planet into Star Fox Adventures. Sabre was replaced by Fox McCloud, while Krystal was reduced to a minor role as a damsel in distress. Many of the original elements and characters from Dinosaur Planet were scrapped or changed, such as the magic system, the tribal factions, and the plot. The game also switched platforms from the Nintendo 64 to the GameCube, which allowed for better graphics and performance.
 
Star Fox Adventures was released in 2002 as Rare's last game for Nintendo before being acquired by Microsoft. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics, controls, and gameplay variety. However, many fans of the Star Fox series were disappointed by the game's departure from the traditional space shooter gameplay of previous entries.
